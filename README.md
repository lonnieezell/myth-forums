JUST GETTING STARTED - NOT USABLE!

This aims to be a fully functional forum software based on CodeIgniter 4.

It's future is unknown but I hope to get it to the point that it can be used for CodeIgniter's site at some point in the future. We're just getting started, though. 

At the very least, this should form a pretty good bit of example code for CI developers.

## Requirements

- PHP 7.2+
- composer installed
- npm installed (I'm using 10.x currently)

## Installation

Everything is manual currently, so clone the repo and do the following: 

- composer install
- npm install
- npm run dev
